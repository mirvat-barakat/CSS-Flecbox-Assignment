Uncle Bob continues his second part of the lecture by having a quick change of topic into a discussion 
 about the origin of the moon and then continue with explaining the basics for a clean code.

*Comments: 
comments could be good and could be really bad and should not be commented on.
The proper use of a comment is to look at the comment as an unfortunate necessity.
We should not try to fix bad code by adding comments.

Bad comments include: mumbling, redundant comments where it takes more time to understand than the code,
 mandated comments, journal comments, noise comments, closing brace comments, attribution comments,
and comments outside the code.

*Vertical formatting: file size is not a function of project size statistics show that there is no correlation between file size and distribution.

*Horizontal formatting: the fact that our screens are getting bigger does not affect the code lines' length.

*Names: there are some naming rules to take into consideration including:
Variable name length should be proportional to the scope.
Name of the function is inveresly proportional to the size of the scope and it is the same for classes.
